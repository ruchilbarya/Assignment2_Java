I have used the 'If else' to write the code.First I have taken the average of grade1 , grade2 , grade3 , grade4, grade5 and print it.
If the average is between 90 to 100 then print "A: Fantastic job!".
If the average is between 80 to 89.99 then print "B: Good!"
If the average is between 70 to 79.99 then print "C: Please try more next time !"
If the average is less than or equal to 69.99 then print "F:Unfortunately you failed !"
if these conditons are not met "you do not have a grade"
